# _CLIENTS

One subdirectory per client engagement.

## Don't run Claude from this directory

Claude should be invoked from a specific client subfolder (e.g. `~/Documents/_CLIENTS/acme-corp/`), not from `_CLIENTS/` itself. Each client has its own AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md, knowledge base, projects - context is per-client, not shared.

If you start Claude here at the `_CLIENTS/` level, it has no specific client context and will likely produce generic output that doesn't match any of your engagements.

## Per-client structure

A scaffolded client directory looks like this:

```
acme-corp/
├── AGENTS.md                 ← canonical: client name, engagement type, scope, contacts
├── CLAUDE.md                 ← symlink to AGENTS.md
├── README.md                 ← changelog, current state, status
├── notes.md                  ← brain dump for this client
├── log.md                    ← audit log of automations
├── docs/
│   ├── inbox/                ← drop documents here; Claude can ingest them into the KB when asked
│   │   └── done/             ← processed files moved here once ingested
│   ├── knowledge-base/       ← curated, AI-readable knowledge
│   │   └── drafts/           ← staging area for ingestion candidates
│   ├── meetings/             ← meeting transcripts, summaries
│   └── research/             ← topic-specific research outputs
├── projects/                 ← concrete projects for this client (one subfolder each)
└── research/                 ← generic research that doesn't fit a specific project
```

## Adding a new client

1. Copy `_example-client/` to a new directory named for the client (e.g. `acme-corp/`).
2. Edit `AGENTS.md` with the client's name, your engagement type, and scope.
3. Re-create the `CLAUDE.md` symlink: `cd acme-corp && ln -sfn AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`.
4. Open Claude in that directory and start working.

Or use the `setup` skill: `cd ~/Documents/_CLIENTS/new-client/ && claude` then `/setup`.

## Notes and inbox (both manual)

- **`notes.md`**: a plain file for ideas and impulses about this client. No hook reads it and nothing is sent anywhere; when a note deserves research, ask Claude for it.

The `docs/inbox/` and `docs/inbox/done/` directories exist as a manual workflow - drop a file in `inbox/`, ask Claude to summarize and ingest it into `knowledge-base/drafts/`, move the source to `inbox/done/`. Not an automated hook in this pack (the upstream starter pack has an `inbox-processor` hook if you want it; this pack omits it by default to keep per-edit API costs predictable).

## What's NOT included

- No `scripts/` per client. Client-specific scripts go in `projects/{project}/scripts/` or `~/.claude/scripts/` for personal tools.
- No client keys in `~/.claude/.env`. Each client gets its own `.env` (schema in `.env.example`, created by `/setup`); `~/.claude/.env` holds only account-level keys. List key names without values via `~/.claude/scripts/list-env-keys.sh --from <path>`.
- No tool-specific configs (package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.) at the client level - those live inside individual projects.
