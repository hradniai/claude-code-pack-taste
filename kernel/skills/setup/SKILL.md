# Project Setup

Interactive project scaffolding. Replaces /init with structured project type selection.

**File convention:** AGENTS.md is the canonical project intent file (cross-tool standard adopted by Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, Aider, etc.). CLAUDE.md is a symlink to AGENTS.md so Claude Code reads the same content natively. Both files always point to the same source. The deeper tool-specific config (`.claude/rules/`, `.claude/settings.json`, hooks) stays Claude Code-specific.

## Step 1: Detect context

1. Note the current working directory (CWD).
2. Check if AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md exists in CWD (either is a sign the project was already scaffolded).
3. Check if README.md exists.
4. Scan directory for existing files/folders (ls -la, max 2 levels).

## Step 2: Ask project type

Present these options to the user:

```
Project setup for: {CWD basename}

1. Klient   - per-client engagement (typically lives in _CLIENTS/{name}/)
2. Business - your own business work (typically lives in _BUSINESS/projects/{name}/)
3. App      - tool/app you build for reuse (typically lives in _APPS/{name}/)
4. Dev      - generic development project (any location)
5. General  - community, initiative, research, experiment (any location)
6. Just clean up - keep existing AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, add missing references
```

Wait for the user's choice. Do NOT proceed without it.

## Step 3: Gather info

Based on choice, ask the user for template placeholders. Use directory name as default project name. Ask only what's needed - skip optional fields unless the user wants to fill them.

**Klient:** CLIENT_NAME, INDUSTRY, ENGAGEMENT_TYPE, ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION
**Business:** BUSINESS_CONTEXT (e.g. "consulting offering rebuild", "course development", "internal automation")
**App:** APP_NAME, TECH_STACK, ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION, exposure type (skill/plugin/API/standalone)
**Dev:** PROJECT_NAME, TECH_STACK, ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION
**General:** PROJECT_NAME, type (community/initiative/research/experiment), ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION
**Clean up:** No questions - just scan and update.

## Step 4: Create AGENTS.md (canonical) + CLAUDE.md symlink

- Read template from `~/.claude/templates/{type}-claude.md`:
  - Klient → `klient-claude.md`
  - Business → `business-claude.md`
  - App → `app-claude.md`
  - Dev → `dev-claude.md`
  - General → `general-claude.md`
- Fill in placeholders with user's answers.
- Write the filled content to `AGENTS.md` (NOT CLAUDE.md - AGENTS.md is canonical).
- Create `CLAUDE.md` as a symlink to `AGENTS.md` so Claude Code reads it natively:
  ```bash
  ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
  ```
- If AGENTS.md already exists, show diff preview and ask for confirmation before overwriting.
- If CLAUDE.md exists as a regular file (legacy), ask the user whether to:
  (a) migrate: rename CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md, then create CLAUDE.md symlink
  (b) keep as-is and skip
- If CLAUDE.md is already a symlink to AGENTS.md, do nothing - already in the right state.
- For option 6 (clean up): read existing AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, scan directory structure, add missing references. Do NOT replace.

Note: the template filenames keep `-claude.md` suffix as a legacy internal label. Their content is written to AGENTS.md regardless.

## Step 5: Scaffold directories

Create only what doesn't already exist. Never overwrite existing files.

**All types:**
- `.claude/rules/` (empty directory)
- `notes.md` (skeleton: `# Notes\n\nIdeas, brain dumps, future automations.`)
- `research/` (empty directory)
- `.gitignore` from the standard template (single source of truth - never hand-write it inline):
  ```bash
  [ -f .gitignore ] || cp ~/.claude/templates/gitignore .gitignore
  ```
  Copy-if-missing (never overwrite). To keep files away from Claude Code, use `Read(...)` rules in `permissions.deny` of the project's `.claude/settings.json` (Claude Code does not read `.claudeignore`; source: an Anthropic collaborator on https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16704).
- `.env.example` (type-specific schema) + `.env.shared` (soft tier), copy-if-missing. Map the project type to the template: Klient→`klient`, Dev→`dev`, App→`app`, General/Business→`general`.
  ```bash
  [ -f .env.example ] || cp ~/.claude/templates/{type}-env.example .env.example   # {type} = klient|dev|app|general
  [ -f .env.shared ]  || cp ~/.claude/templates/env-shared.example .env.shared
  ```
  These are EMPTY schemas with requirement notes in `#` comments, NEVER real values (a weak example value like `password=changeme` would teach Claude to generate weak secrets). `.env.example` documents which keys this workspace type uses; real secrets go in `.env` (HARD, Claude never reads), soft low-risk values go in `.env.shared` (Claude-readable). Account-level keys are NOT per-project - they live in the global `~/.claude/.env`. See `respect-denies.md` for the three env tiers.

> **Secrets convention.** `.env` and `.env.*` are gitignored, and Claude is hard-blocked from reading their values (deny rules + the `bash-safety-extended.py` hook, which covers `cat`/`source`/redirection/`python -c`/docker-mount and the `Read` tool). The ONE readable env file is **`.env.shared`** - the soft tier for low-risk values safe to surface (a notify webhook, a contact email). `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production` and every other `.env.*` are HARD: their values never reach Claude (`.env.local` is HARD on purpose - the JS ecosystem treats it as the live-secret file, so live keys land there). Placeholders (`.env.example`/`.sample`/`.template`) are readable. To learn the key NAMES of a hard env without exposing values, Claude runs `~/.claude/scripts/list-env-keys.sh --from <path>`; add `--classify` to also get each key's value-STATE (empty / placeholder / filled + kind, e.g. `api_key`/`token`/`webhook_url`) - the value is read only to derive the label and is never surfaced.

**Klient:**
- `docs/meetings/transcripts/`
- `docs/knowledge-base/`
- `docs/knowledge-base/drafts/`
- `docs/assets/`
- `docs/inbox/`
- `docs/inbox/done/`
- `docs/presales/`
- `docs/strategy/`
- `docs/strategy/archive/`
- `docs/research/`
- `docs/review/`
- `docs/final/`
- `projects/`
- Mandatory MD files (create only if they don't exist):
  - `log.md` (skeleton: `# Log\n`)
  - `docs.md` (skeleton: `# Docs Index\n\n| Date | Document | Status | Link |\n|------|----------|--------|------|\n`)
  - `meetings.md` (skeleton: `# Meetings\n\n| Date | Topic | Key Points |\n|------|-------|------------|\n`)
  - `worklog.md` (skeleton: `# Worklog\n\n| Timestamp | Type | Project | Description | Files |\n|-----------|------|---------|-------------|-------|\n`)

**Business:**
- `projects/`
- `education/`
- `research/`
- `docs/`
- `scripts/`

**Dev:**
- `docs/features/`
- `docs/decisions/`
- `docs/guides/setup.md` (empty skeleton with `# Setup` header)
- `src/`

**App:**
- `docs/features/`
- `docs/decisions/`
- `docs/guides/`
- `src/`
- `scripts/`
- Create skill skeleton at `~/.claude/skills/{app-name-lowercase}/SKILL.md`:
  ```
  ---
  name: {app-name-lowercase}
  description: TODO
  ---

  # {APP_NAME}

  TODO: Define skill interface.
  ```

**General:**
- `docs/`
- `scripts/`

**Clean up:**
- No directory creation. Only update AGENTS.md (or CLAUDE.md if AGENTS.md doesn't yet exist) references.

## Step 6: Create README.md

Only if README.md doesn't exist. Skeleton:

```markdown
# {PROJECT_NAME}

Created: {YYYY-MM-DD}

## Overview

{ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION}

## Status

In progress.
```

## Step 7: Initialize local git (safety net)

Give the new workspace a local time machine from day one - local only, no GitHub, no push:

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/git-autosave.sh ensure   # git init + standard .gitignore from ~/.claude/templates/gitignore (only if missing)
```

Run it from the project folder. Then take the first snapshot only if a repository now exists:

```bash
if git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  git add -A && git commit -q -m "chore: scaffold project" && echo "first snapshot committed"
else
  echo "no git repository here: local safety net NOT set up"
fi
```

`ensure` works only inside the workspace root: `PACK_WORKSPACE_ROOT` from the `env` block of `~/.claude/settings.json` (written during install), else `~/Documents`. Outside it, `ensure` does nothing on purpose. When the check above prints "NOT set up", tell the user in one sentence that this folder has no local safety net, name the root the script uses, and offer the choice: move the project under that root, or change `PACK_WORKSPACE_ROOT` (a settings change they approve, applied from the next session). Never report the safety net as set up when it is not.

`ensure` is a no-op if git already exists; it never overwrites an existing `.gitignore`, and it does NOT set a git identity (it uses the user's own global `~/.gitconfig`). Commits stay local - pushing to GitHub is always a separate, deliberate action.

## Step 8: Summary

Report what was created:
- Files created/modified (list)
- Directories created (list)
- Skill linked (if App type)
- Next steps suggestion

Do NOT create WORKSTATE.md or MEMORY.md - those are created on demand per `documentation-standard.md`.
