# Claude Code Pack - Taste edition

Baseline Claude Code configuration tuned for an agency power-user cohort: ambassadors and technically curious marketers who write Python scripts, build small apps with Claude Code, and do knowledge work day-to-day.

Forked and adapted from [Gillellbor/claude-starter-pack](https://github.com/Gillellbor/claude-starter-pack). Differences from upstream are listed at the bottom.

> **Audience:** the 10–15 person ambassador / power-user layer in an agency. Smart enough to install dependencies and read errors. Not enterprise IT.

## Pro úplné začátečníky (česky)

Pokud je tvoje zkušenost s AI claude.ai a nic víc - začni krátkým [**`UZIVATELSKY-MANUAL.md`**](UZIVATELSKY-MANUAL.md). Přečteš za půl minuty, dozvíš se, co Pack dělá a proč.

## What you get

### Kernel (`~/.claude/`)
- **Restrictive `settings.json`** - destructive bash patterns, sensitive file reads, browser cookie/history dirs, and `--no-verify` style escapes are denied at the global level. Bypass mode is locked off.
- **Bash safety hook** - catches two-step download-execute, subshell bypasses, secret-file reads (every `.env` except the deliberate `.env.local` handoff, via bash or the Read tool), browser data extraction, and `python -c` bypasses.
- **Context-bloat guard** - soft brake on `Read` of files larger than ~50k tokens. Forces Claude to either chunk the read or ask the user to confirm. Prevents the "Claude loaded an 80MB CSV and now the session is dead" scenario.
- **Auto-research hook** - detects unmarked notes in `notes.md`, dispatches background research via the Anthropic API, marks each as ✅ (research done) or ⏭️ (skipped).
- **Time-injection hook** - adds the current local time to Claude's context every prompt.
- **Statusline** - three-line live status (model · throughput · cost / project · branch · context / 5-hour and 7-day rate-limit usage). Lets you see when you're burning through your team-plan allotment.
- **Five rules** - documentation standard, respect-denies behavior, subagent usage guide, notes convention, Czech-output style (banned AI calques, native Czech requirements).
- **Five skills** - `setup` (project scaffolding), `skill-creator`, `prd-creator`, `dr-prompt`, `client-data-check` (PII scanner for files before they leave the machine).
- **Helper script** - `list-env-keys.sh` exposes *names* of credential env vars without ever revealing values.

### Workspace (chosen path, default `~/Documents/`)
- `_CONTEXT/` - personal profile, notes, best-practices.
- `_CLIENTS/` - per-client engagements, including a pre-built `taste/` scaffold to start with.
- `_BUSINESS/` - your own work outside any single client (offers, training material, internal projects).
- `_APPS/` - small tools and apps you build (one example included).

You choose where these live during install - no `~/Documents/` lock-in.

### File convention
Every project root has both `AGENTS.md` (canonical, cross-tool standard) and `CLAUDE.md` (symlink to AGENTS.md). One source of truth, readable by Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, Aider, and any other AGENTS.md-aware tool.

## Install

You don't run an install script. You let Claude walk you through it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/claude-code-pack-taste.git ~/Downloads/claude-code-pack-taste
cd ~/Downloads/claude-code-pack-taste
claude
```

Claude reads `INSTRUCTIONS.md` in the current directory, runs a pre-flight check (OS, dependencies, existing setup), and asks for your approval at every major step - including **where you want your workspace directories to live**. It does not assume `~/Documents/`.

If you already have a `~/.claude/` setup, the install respects it - backup is automatic, nothing is overwritten without your confirmation.

### Dependency expectations

The Pack assumes `python3`, `node`, `git`, `jq`, and `curl` are on PATH. If anything is missing, Claude stops and gives you the install command for your OS - it does not install dependencies for you (that's a system change you should make explicitly).

- **macOS:** Homebrew (`brew install python3 node git jq curl`)
- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** `apt install python3 nodejs git jq curl`
- **Linux (Fedora/RHEL):** `dnf install python3 nodejs git jq curl`
- **Windows:** WSL2 strongly recommended. Native Windows works but requires manual path adjustments and PowerShell rewrites of Bash hooks - see the Windows addendum in `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

## What this is not

- **Not a turnkey product.** You will edit files, add your own rules, and shape this to your work.
- **Not a hard cost cap.** Team-plan limits are per-seat, and hard token caps would block real work. The Pack ships the statusline so you can *see* your usage; what you do with that is up to you.
- **Not enterprise-grade.** The safety model protects against accidents and AI mistakes - not against a determined adversary on your machine. For locked-down environments, use endpoint-managed settings (`/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`).
- **Not a magic context for every AI tool.** AGENTS.md gives portable intent across tools, but each tool's deeper config (settings, permissions, hooks) is vendor-specific.

## Differences from the upstream starter pack

What changed in this fork:

- **Statusline added** (`kernel/statusline.sh`) - three-line live status with cost, context, and 5h/7d rate-limit usage. Important for team-plan visibility.
- **Browser data added to deny** - Safari/Chrome/Chromium/Firefox/Brave/Edge/Arc cookie and history directories are unreadable. Vibe-coded scripts shouldn't quietly mine your session cookies.
- **`context-bloat-guard.py` hook added** - soft brake on huge file reads.
- **Bash safety hook extended** - browser data extraction patterns, `python -c` bypass patterns.
- **`czech-output.md` rule added** - for teams that write Czech, enforces native Czech style and blocks AI calques.
- **`client-data-check` skill added** - offline PII scanner.
- **`inbox-processor.sh` hook removed** - per-edit API calls were nudging team-plan usage; teams can re-enable it from the upstream if they want.
- **`_CLIENTS/taste/` scaffold included** - pre-built example client workspace.
- **INSTRUCTIONS.md interactive interview rewritten** - explicit workspace-path prompt (no `~/Documents/` assumption), OS-specific dependency setup, conflict checks before any overwrite.
